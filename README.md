# bamazon

This application was created to mimic an online storefront (amazon being the example) to purchase goods. 

1. To use this application clone the repository and type 'node bamazoncustomer.js"

2. Once the application has booted up enter the number for the item you wish to purchase. 

3. Once prompted enter the amount you would like to purchase for the item selected. 

4. If the item is in stock you will get a checkout prompt letting you know your total.

5. If the item is out of stock or the amount inputed is more than the total quantity the application will refresh and let you start again.
